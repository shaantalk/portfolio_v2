My website created in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Google Firebase.

 1. I have used things like LineIcons.css and Typed.js to make the UI look good.
 2. I have also added Google Analytics to the code to track users.
 3. The images and project details comes from a storage bucket and a Realtime database in Google Firebase.
